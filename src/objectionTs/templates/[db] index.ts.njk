{#-
  This template's file name starts with "[db]", so it will be executed only once and `Db` object added to the context.
  "o" and "db" are same. They are the "db" object, "x" is the extra context if available any.
  See details of "db" here: https://www.pg-structure.com/nav.02.api/classes/db.html

  Decide whether to include schema name by reading `addSchemaName` boolean value from extra context.
  `dboClassName` filter provided by "pg-generator". See "src/get-nunjucks" for an example.
